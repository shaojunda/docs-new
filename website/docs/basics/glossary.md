## Economics Glossary

### Base Issuance
The creation of new CKBytes through temporary inflation that is paid to miners through Base Rewards.

Base Issuance is paid for by using a fixed and decreasing inflation schedule. Approximately every four years the amount is halved until eventually stopping when the cap of 33.6 billion CKBytes have been issued.

#### See Also
- [Base Reward](#base-reward)
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Secondary Issuance](#secondary-issuance)

---

### Base Reward
A subsidy paid to miners in CKBytes for providing the compute and storage requirements required for processing transactions and persisting data on Nervos.

Base Rewards are created from Base Issuance and will decrease over time until eventually ending.

#### See Also
- [Base Issuance](#base-issuance)
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Miner](#miner)

#### See Also
- [Cryptocurrency](#cryptocurrency)
- [Digital Currency](#digital-currency)

---

### Heavy Asset Problem
A common problem found in multi-asset blockchain platforms where the value of the assets stored on the chain gains significant value but the native token of the chain does not. This raises the incentive to attack the the network, but does not increase the security because the value of the native token is what is used to secure the network.

#### See Also
- [Asset](#asset)
- [Starving Layer 1 Problem](#starving-layer-1-problem)
- [Tragedy of the Security Commons](#tragedy-of-the-security-commons)

#### See Also
- [Asset](#asset)

---

### Proposal Reward

#### See Also
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Confirmation](#confirmation)
- [Miner](#miner)
- [Transaction](#transaction)

---

### Secondary Issuance
The creation of new CKBytes through limited and decreasing inflation that is paid to miners through Secondary Rewards.

Secondary Issuance follows a fixed inflation schedule of 1.344 billion CKBytes per year. This amount does not change. Unlike Base Issuance, Secondary Issuance does not affect everyone on the network. It is a small and targeted inflation from users that occupy space on Nervos or hold their CKBytes outside of the Nervos DAO.

### Secondary Reward
A subsidy paid to miners in CKBytes for providing the compute and storage requirements required for processing transactions and persisting data on Nervos.

#### See Also
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Miner](#miner)
- [Secondary Issuance](#secondary-issuance)
- [Transaction](#transaction)

---

### Starving Layer 1 Problem
A scenario that can arise in multi-layer blockchain platforms where the vast majority of the transaction traffic moves from layer 1 to layer 2, taking the vast majority of transaction fees with it. If layer 1 relies exclusively on transaction fees to support the security of the platform, it may end up not having enough incentives available to properly secure it.

---

### Tail Emission
A type of reward that is paid to miners through a fixed amount of inflation.

#### See Also

#### See Also
- [Tragedy of the Security Commons](#tragedy-of-the-security-commons)
- [Tragedy of the Storage Commons](#tragedy-of-the-storage-commons)

---

### Tragedy of the Security Commons
A situation that can emerge on multi-asset blockchain platforms where asset tokens rely on the storage and security of the blockchain platform, but do not contribute back to the platform. As the number of assets that "ride for free" increases, so does the burden placed on the underlying blockchain platform. If the assets do not contribute to the underlying platform, the available security may not properly support the network.

#### See Also
- [Heavy Asset Problem](#heavy-asset-problem)
- [Tragedy of the Commons](#tragedy-of-the-commons)
- [Tragedy of the Storage Commons](#tragedy-of-the-storage-commons)

---

### Tragedy of the Storage Commons
A situation that can emerge on incentivized blockchain platforms where mining rewards are paid for inclusion of data to the blockchain, but no rewards exist for the long-term persistance of the blockchain data. As the size of the chain grows, so do the costs associated with persisting the data. If there is no direct incentive for persisting data, fewer and fewer nodes will do so. Eventually, too few nodes will be available to properly support the network.
