title: Header compact_target
---

`compact_target` is the encoded form of the target threshold as it appears in the block header.

It is similar to `nBits` of bitcoin, the original `nBits` implementation inherits properties from a signed data class, allowing the target threshold to be negative if the high bit of the significand is set. This is uselessâ€”the header hash is treated as an unsigned number, so it can never be equal to or lower than a negative target threshold.

In CKB, the "compact" format is a representation of a whole number N using an unsigned 32bit number similar to a
floating-point format. 

* The most significant 8 bits are the unsigned exponent of base 256.
* This exponent can be thought of as "number of bytes of N". 
* The lower 24 bits are the mantissa. 

N = mantissa * 256^(exponent-3)

Python 3 Example and test vectors:
```python
import unittest

def compact_to_target(compact):
    exponent = compact >> 24
    mantissa = compact & 0x00ffffff
    rtn = 0
    if (exponent <= 3):
        mantissa >>= (8 * (3 - exponent))
        rtn = mantissa
    else:
        rtn = mantissa
        rtn <<= (8 * (exponent - 3))
    overflow = mantissa != 0 and (exponent > 32)
    return rtn, overflow


def target_to_compact(target):
    bits = (target).bit_length()
    exponent = ((bits + 7) // 8)
    compact = target << (
        8 * (3 - exponent)) if exponent <= 3 else (target >> (8 * (exponent - 3)))
    compact = (compact | (exponent << 24))
    return compact


class TestCompactTarget(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_compact_target1(self):
        compact = target_to_compact(0x2)
        self.assertEqual('0x1020000', hex(compact))
        target, overflow = compact_to_target(0x1020000)
        self.assertTupleEqual((2, False), (target, overflow))

    def test_compact_target2(self):
        compact = target_to_compact(0xfe)
        self.assertEqual('0x1fe0000', hex(compact))
        target, overflow = compact_to_target(0x1fedcba)
        self.assertTupleEqual((0xfe, False), (target, overflow))

    unittest.main()
